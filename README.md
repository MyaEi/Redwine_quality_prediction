# Red Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of red wine using machine learning techniques. It was developed as a course project at Fanshawe College and demonstrates skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict wine quality scores and classify high-quality wines using physicochemical properties.
- **Techniques:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, MLP (Neural Network), Gradient Boosting (GridSearchCV tuning).
- **Dataset:** [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) (red wine).

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression and classification tasks
- Model comparison and hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results and feature importance

## Files
- `FinalProject_win_myaei.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with code, analysis, and results.
- `Final Project Presentation_Win_MyaEi.pdf`: Project presentation slides.
- `Final Project Report_Win_MyaEi.pdf`: Detailed project report.
- `Red Wine Prediction Presentation.pptx`: Additional presentation material.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Download the [winequality-red.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv) dataset and place it in the project folder.
4. Open and run `FinalProject_win_myaei.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance for both regression and classification.
- Feature importance and confusion matrix visualizations included.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Machine learning model development and tuning
- Evaluation and interpretation of results
- Communication of findings (report and presentation)
